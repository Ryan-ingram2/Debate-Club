      <p>Which is the superior social media platform in todays market, Twitter or Instagram? 
          Today's world revolves around social media and each company is fighting for its market share, 
          especially with Teens and young adults. Below we are going to go over the "battle" between Twitter and its counterpart Instagram. </p>

    <h2 class="hidden">Instagram</h2>

     <p>Instagram is the superior social media when it comes to interaction between each other.
        Instagram has much better UI, and is easier to navigate for someone who is both new or old to social media. 
        Its simple design has lead to more than 50 billion pieces of content being shared, with an even more staggering 95 million shared per day.
        Instagrams platform makes it perfect for interaction with old family and friends, 
        as well as discovering new ones. The ability to share photos with one another makes it the ideal application for creating your own timeline, 
        and sharing that with others of your choosing.
        Twitter is one of the most boring social media platforms.
        The user wants to see the content, and they want to experience it. Although tweets and paragraphs do have their place in social media, 
        the main core of it will always be general content that the user enjoys- which Instagram provides a lot of.
        Twitter is also a very non interactive social media, as you donâ€™t have your friends or family on Twitter,
         it would be weird to. Instead you follow random people and businesses, taking away that humanity you feel from at least seeing one another.

    <h3 class="hidden">Twitter</h3>

     <p>Twitter on the other hand provides the simplest yet most diverse mode of application. By giving users the large outreach in both simple and complex discussion points, 
         Twitter is surely the crown of social media.With over 500 million tweets made per day, or over 200 billion per year, Twitter is the place where the discussion happens. 
         From breaking news, the new funniest videos, to seeing what your friends think about a subject, Twitter has everything that the user craves.
         Twitter is much more informative, and although it provides all forms of content, the classic tweet is a staple of social media and the culture that is happening today.
         Instagram is actually not the superior application. Instagram has become the underwhelming expectation of social media, and one that frequently under delivers. 
         The messaging system is very primitive when compared to other such applications such as Twitter. 
         Instagram also has very poor security in comparison to Twitter. Although hacks may appear in the news for both, those that follow instagram are very damaging for the average user, 
         from hidden posts to addresses to real names.</p>
