     <p>Instagram is the superior social media when it comes to interaction between each other.
        Instagram has much better UI, and is easier to navigate for someone who is both new or old to social media. 
        Its simple design has lead to more than 50 billion pieces of content being shared, with an even more staggering 95 million shared per day.
        Instagrams platform makes it perfect for interaction with old family and friends, 
        as well as discovering new ones. The ability to share photos with one another makes it the ideal application for creating your own timeline, 
        and sharing that with others of your choosing.
        Twitter is one of the most boring social media platforms.
        The user wants to see the content, and they want to experience it. Although tweets and paragraphs do have their place in social media, 
        the main core of it will always be general content that the user enjoys- which Instagram provides a lot of.
        Twitter is also a very non interactive social media, as you donâ€™t have your friends or family on Twitter,
         it would be weird to. Instead you follow random people and businesses, taking away that humanity you feel from at least seeing one another.
